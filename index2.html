<p> Above is an image of the Panda Lava Buns!</p>

<div class="box">
  <h3>This is my first attempt at using CSS to put a box around text
</h3>
<P> I decided to make this box white (because that's is what I am most likely to use on my sites going forward) with a thin black boarder. I also made sure to center my text within the box with space for margins. I also played around with including both a header and body text within the same box! 
</P>
<p>I think this formatting will be very helpful for future sites, especially if they have a complicated background like the ombre one I used here. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
  <p>Look! Here is another CSS box with prettier colors. The first time I added this green box I accidently turned the box above green as well. Then I realized that I had to make sure they has different classes... ie: "box" and "box2". Honestly, quite proud of figuring that one out on my own dispite it being a decently simple concept. It's about the little things in life I guess haha!</p>
</div>
<div class="box3">
  <p>Just when you thought that boxes couldn't possibly get more interesting... I introduce box 3: the color changing box. I know, I know. Crazy. Groundbreaking. Life-altering. Religion-inspiring. Climate Crisis Reversing. </p>
</div>
<div class="box4">
  <p>Being honest, this box took everything out of me. This will be the final box of this week for me.</p>
